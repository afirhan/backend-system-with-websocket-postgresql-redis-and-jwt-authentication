# Backend System with WebSocket, PostgreSQL, Redis, and JWT Authentication
This project implements a backend system with WebSocket communication, PostgreSQL for data storage, Redis caching, and JWT-based authentication with role-based access control. The system uses raw SQL queries, stores threat data from Radware's live threat map, and includes unit tests to ensure endpoint functionality.
